A Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is a grammar where the substitution rules (called "productions") can be applied regardless of the context.

A rule like A → 0A1 means "The variable A can be replaced by the string '0A1'."

The "context-free" part means A can always be replaced by '0A1', no matter what symbols are to its left or right.

This is different from context-sensitive grammars, where rules might depend on surrounding symbols.`,
